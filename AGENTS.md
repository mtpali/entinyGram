# mtpali/entinyGram fork scope

All repository writes, PRs and releases for this personal fork target **mtpali/entinyGram**. `entaytion/entinyGram`, `teidesu/inugram` and `DrKLO/Telegram` are read-only dependencies. The user authorized this task's edits, validation, commits, pushes, PR preparation and APK builds through develoop/pr-completion. Work on a feature branch; follow the invoked PR workflow for landing. Build APKs using GitHub Actions. Do not send Telegram channel messages without an explicit request.

The upstream guide below describes the inherited patch architecture. Its original remote names and direct-to-main workflow do not apply to this personal fork.

# entinyGram Agent Guide

**entinyGram** is our independent fork of **inugram** (`teidesu/inugram`), which is built as
an stgit patchset on stock Telegram Android. Fork code lives in `src/kotlin` and `src/res`
(symlinked into the `worktree/`). `patches/` and `series` are stgit export targets, not the source of truth.

`FEATURES.md` is the user-facing list of fork features/bugfixes. Keep it in sync —
when adding, removing, or meaningfully changing a patch, update `FEATURES.md` in the same change.

---

## 0. THE PARANOIA PROTOCOL (Read First, Always Obey)

1. **Be Paranoid — Ask 100 Times Before Doing:**
   - If ANY instruction is ambiguous, vague, or shorthand: **STOP AND ASK**. Never assume, guess, or take liberties.
   - Present a clear, concise plan of action before modifying files or stack state.
   - Better to clarify 100 times than to introduce unrequested changes, corrupt patches, or touch external remotes.

2. **Commit & Push ONLY on Explicit, Per-Action Approval & Per-Feature Scope:**
   - **Never auto-commit.** An earlier "commit this" applies ONLY to that single change. It NEVER grants permission to commit follow-up fixes or chain commits on momentum.
   - **One Feature = One Commit:** When adding a new feature, commit EXCLUSIVELY that feature alone. Never lump unrelated fixes, refactors, or multiple features into one kitchen sink. (Global cleanup/chores can be batched before release).
   - Present the diff/summary and STOP. Wait for an explicit "commit" / "зроби" / "ок".
   - **Never auto-push.** Pushing to remote requires its own separate explicit confirmation.

3. **Strict Fork Isolation — ZERO Upstream Pollution:**
   - All tasks, code, and bugfixes belong **exclusively** to THIS fork (`entinyGram`).
   - **NEVER open Pull Requests or issues to upstream inugram (`teidesu/inugram`) or official Telegram.** We do not work for upstream and do not submit our changes to them.
   - When using `gh` CLI for ANY reason, **ALWAYS explicitly pass `--repo entaytion/entinyGram`**. Never rely on default remote resolution (gh can default to upstream and create an irreversible public PR).
   - Our standard workflow is local commit and direct push to `main` on `origin` (entaytion/entinyGram) upon explicit approval — no PRs.

4. **Zero Comment Spam / Zero Bloat (Keep it Clean):**
   - **Default to NO comments at all.** Only comment when code is completely inexplicable.
   - If a comment is strictly required: **max 1 line**, tagged `// entiny: <one sentence>`.
   - **NEVER** write multi-paragraph explanations, rationale tirades, or class/function `/** ... */` docblocks.
   - If design rationale or notes are genuinely needed for future reference, put them in a scratch file under `entinyProto/<feature-name>/NOTES.md`, NEVER inline in code or patches.
   - No orphan files, no temporary experiment junk, no unnecessary abstractions or wrappers.

5. **Never Touch the User's Device:**
   - No `adb install`, `adb shell`, `adb logcat`, `adb push`, or app-launching commands.
   - Ask the user to run/install and paste logs if needed.

6. **Dirty Worktree / Multi-Agent Patch Isolation (Never Blanket Refresh):**
   - Multiple agents often work concurrently on the same codebase, leaving unstaged modifications in `worktree/` (`gifvideo.cpp`, `DialogCell.java`, `MainTabsActivity.java`, etc.).
   - **NEVER run bare `stg refresh` or `stg new -r` without path/index filtering.** A bare refresh indiscriminately pulls all modified files into the current patch, destroying other agents' work and creating a toxic kitchen-sink patch.
   - **Index-Only Patch Creation (`stg new -r -i`):**
     1. Check staged state: `git -C worktree diff --cached` (must be completely empty).
     2. Stage ONLY your files/hunks:
        - Entire file: `git -C worktree add path/to/MyFile.java`.
        - Specific hunk from a shared file: isolate your hunk into a diff and stage via `git -C worktree apply --cached my_hunk.patch`.
     3. Strict verification: `git -C worktree diff --cached` — verify not a single line from another agent or feature is staged.
     4. Create patch from index: `stg -C worktree new -r -i -m "[*] <subject>" entiny__<name>`.
     5. Verify patch content: `stg -C worktree show --stat`.
     6. Leaves other agents' unstaged files untouched in the working directory.

---

## 1. Golden Rules (Never Violate)

1. **entinyGram Owns `patches/entiny/`:** All our features, bugfixes, and tweaks live under `patches/entiny/` and are named `entiny__<name>`. Upstream groups (`bugfix`, `feature`, `debloat`, `hooks`, `misc`) belong to the inugram base. NEVER create a new entinyGram patch under `feature/` or `debloat/`.
2. **Search Origin First (Do NOT Reinvent):** Check if stock or inugram already has the feature before writing anything (`InuConfig`, `src/kotlin/helpers`, `series`). If inugram has it, use theirs. Never build parallel toggles, duplicate drawables, or rewrite stock hotspots.
3. **Stock Patches Stay Tiny & Code-Only:** Only 1–5 lines of Java hooks/guards in `worktree/TMessagesProj/src/main/java/...`. Real logic goes into Kotlin helpers (`src/kotlin/helpers/`). **NEVER put drawables, assets, or XML resources inside `.patch` files.** All assets live in `src/res/`.
4. **Edit `worktree/` Directly:** Never hand-edit `patches/*.patch` or `series` — they regenerate from stgit.
5. **Do Not Run `stg` or `git` Yourself:** Unless explicitly asked. Read-only `stg top` / `stg show` is fine. NEVER run `stg export`.
6. **Default Off = Stock-Identical:** Every behavior change must be gated behind `InuConfig.*.getValue()`. Default is false/stock.
7. **Take Over Existing Patches Properly:** When modifying an inherited inugram patch, float and rename it first: `stg float <patch>`, `stg rename <old> entiny__<name>` before refreshing.
8. **Never Touch Stock Hotspots for Metadata:** Bubble metadata (time, views, forwards, edited, deleted) MUST go through `ChatHelper.timePrefix`, `ChatHelper.extraTimeWidth`, and `ChatHelper.timeAdditionsHash`. Never patch `ChatMessageCell.java` for this.
9. **Untouchables:**
   - Never touch `TLRPC.java` (auto-generated, rebasing is hell).
   - Never touch stock DB schema or `LAST_DB_VERSION` (fork state goes in `inu_*` tables / `inu_kv` via `InuDatabaseHelper`).
   - No renames in stock, no removing stock imports (except `desu.inugram.*`).
10. **No Local Builds or LSP:** Don't run `./gradlew` or try to compile locally.
11. **Patch Author Name:** Exported patches (`patches/**/*.patch`) must carry `From: Oleksii Kulinich <entaytion@gmail.com>`. Ordinary git commits do not need `--author`.
12. **Debug Logs:** Use `android.util.Log.d`, not `FileLog`.
13. **Icons:** Prefer non-`_solar` icons when an alternative exists. Tabler pack preferred.
14. **Mandatory Pre-Completion Verification:** Run before declaring ANY task done:
    - `bun run tsx scripts/entinychecker.ts` (catches duplicate `SearchRegistry` slugs and unused variants)
    - `bun run tsx scripts/check-translations.ts` (catches missing/stale translations)
    - `bun run lint-patches` (catches patch series overwrites)
    - Update `FEATURES.md` under `## entinyGram additions` (never buried unmarked in `## inuGram additions`).
15. **Release & Version Codes:** Controlled by UTC date and `INU_DAY_STATE` (`YYYYMMDD:N`), dailyCounter 0–9. Check with `gh variable list --repo entaytion/entinyGram`.
16. **Commit Format & Granularity — No AI Essays (`[+]`, `[-]`, `[*]`, `[=]`):**
    - **Never write Conventional Commits or AI Tirades:** No `fix(entiny): ...` essays explaining internal class call stacks or why listeners were changed. Keep it short, human, and directly to the point ("змістовно, але не канцелярно").
    - **NEVER add `Co-Authored-By: ...`** or AI email signatures.
    - **Commit Prefixes:**
      - `[+] <subject>` — New feature / capability added (e.g. `[+] hijri calendar`).
      - `[-] <subject>` — Removing / dropping dead code, providers, or old patches.
      - `[*] <subject>` — Bugfixes, refactoring, or logic modifications (e.g. `[*] translator logic`).
      - `[=] <subject>` — Chores, formatting, maintenance, or upstream syncs (e.g. `[=] sync with upstream inugram`).
    - **Body Structure:** Short description or concise `- ` bullet points:
      ```text
      [+] hijri calendar

      - add hijri calendar support to date picker
      - gate behind InuConfig.HIJRI_CALENDAR
      ```
      ```text
      [*] translator logic

      - collapse provider resolution into unified path
      - fix entity marker resolution indexing
      - drop dead TranSmart and Lingo providers
      ```
    - **One Feature Per Commit:** Each feature gets its own dedicated commit containing EXCLUSIVELY that feature. Batch commits are reserved only for pre-release cleanup or mass sync passes.
17. **Confirm Bug Repro in Unpatched Worktree:** Before treating a visual/behavior issue as a patch regression, verify if stock behaves the same way.
18. **Prefer Data-Layer over UI-Layer:** One hook in a controller beats fifteen hooks in views.
19. **Attribution & Borrowing from Other Forks:** When porting or adapting an existing feature or implementation from another open-source Telegram fork (e.g. AyuGram, ExteraGram, CherryGram, Nekogram, OwlGram, NagramX, etc):
    - Always respect the original creators and credit the source at the end: e.g. `*inspired by / ported from <Fork> (@author)*`.
    - Never claim borrowed implementations as built entirely from scratch.
20. **Concise `FEATURES.md` Entries (Inugram Style):**
    - Keep `FEATURES.md` feature descriptions short, crisp, and directly to the point — mirroring the concise inugram style.
    - **NEVER write essays, design tirades, or multi-paragraph changelog entries in `FEATURES.md`.** One clear sentence or a few compact sub-bullets explaining what the user gets.
    - **Describe only WHAT the user gets.** Never invent or narrate *where* and *how* it works: no implementation mechanics, no option walks, no "with X over Y" flourishes, no roadmap excuses. `**pill stack**: interactive pills in chats search bar - *ported from exteraGram*` is the whole entry.
    - **No maturity labels:** never mark entries `(beta)`, `(wip)`, `(experimental)`, `unstable`, or similar. Ship it or leave it out.
21. **WIP Features in Changelogs:** If a commit mentions `wip` (work in progress) anywhere (subject or body), every changelog / release note entry for that feature MUST say the feature is untested and unstable, and ask users to report bugs (e.g. "⚠️ work in progress: untested and may be unstable — please report any bugs").
22. **Telegram Version Bumps in Changelogs:** When a commit updates the stock Telegram base, the changelog bullet gets exactly one `[*] ` prefix (never repeat the commit subject's own `[*] ` inside the bullet text) followed by a **bold, capitalized** description of who did it: our own rebase onto DrKLO (a commit like `rebase to 12.10.4 (7099)`, done by us before inugram) → `[*] **Rebase to 12.10.4 (ported by entinyGram)**`; an inugram merge that brings the new base → `[*] **Updated to Telegram X.Y.Z (via inugram)**`. The `(ported by entinyGram)` / `(via inugram)` tag stays in English in both the `tg_en` and `tg_uk` release-notes text. Never credit inugram for a base update we ported ourselves.

> You are allowed to violate these rules only if the user explicitly asks.

## 2. Patch Groups & Ownership

Format: `group__name` → `patches/<group>/<name>.patch`. Commit subject = plain human sentence (`Allow editing by double tapping a message`).

| Group | Ownership & Scope |
| --- | --- |
| `entiny` | **entinyGram-owned patches** — our work, not inugram's. Ghost mode, adblock, save-deleted, branding, updater, etc. Live in `patches/entiny/`. Inugram merges never touch this folder. **Always include this group** when listing, searching, auditing, or exporting patches. |
| `bugfix` | Inherited inugram base: upstream bug fixes. |
| `feature` | Inherited inugram base: upstream user-facing capabilities. |
| `debloat` | Inherited inugram base: hides/disables stock behavior behind a toggle. |
| `hooks` | Inherited inugram base: thin stock hooks for fork code to attach to. |
| `misc` | Inherited inugram base: build, branding, infra. |

**A brand-new entinyGram feature is ALWAYS `entiny__<name>`, NEVER `feature__`/`debloat__`/`bugfix__`/`hooks__`/`misc__`.**
Naming our patch `feature__x` misclassifies ownership, breaks merge tracking, and causes accidental overwrites.

**Taking Over an Inugram Patch:**
When you meaningfully modify an inugram base patch, move it into `entiny/`:
```bash
stg float <patch>
stg rename <old> entiny__<name>
```
At that point you own its maintenance.

**Documentation in `FEATURES.md`:**
Every entinyGram feature gets its own bullet under `## entinyGram additions` in `FEATURES.md`, in the topical subsection that fits it (privacy & protection / restricted features / power-user tools / debloat & premium noise) — never left as an unmarked line inside `## inuGram additions`.
- Keep descriptions short, clear, and human-friendly (mirroring inugram style). No AI essays.
- If ported or inspired by another fork, always append a short credit (e.g. `*ported from <Fork>*` or `*inspired by <Fork> (@author)*`).

## 3. Writing Patches & Feature Workflow (The write-patches Rule)

### Hard Stop — Search Origin First
Before writing **any** new feature or toggle:
1. Search **this repo**: `InuConfig`, `src/kotlin/helpers`, `series`, `patches/hooks/`.
2. Search **origin** (`teidesu/inugram`): same names, plus the helper that owns the surface (`ChatHelper` for bubbles, `ProfileHelper` for profile menu, `PullActionHelper` for dialogs pull, etc.).
3. If origin already has it → **keep/use theirs**. Do NOT add `patches/entiny/<same-thing>.patch`, a second `InuConfig` toggle, a second drawable, or a second settings row.
4. Duplicating origin is not "our version" — it is two implementations that fight and break on every upstream merge.

### Where Code Goes

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Feature logic | `src/kotlin/helpers/<area>/` (`ChatHelper`, etc.) |
| Toggle | `InuConfig` + existing settings page (`MessagesSettingsActivity` for bubble chrome) |
| Strings / drawables | `src/res/` — never inside a `.patch` |
| Stock Java | 1–3 line hook: `if (InuConfig.X.getValue()) Helper.foo(this);` or a call already in `patches/hooks/` |
| Bugfix of a stock class | inline in that Java file (this is *not* a feature) |

### Bubble Metadata Rule (ChatMessageCell is Off-Limits)
Bubble metadata (time, forwards, views, edited, deleted) **must** go through:
- `ChatHelper.timePrefix`
- `ChatHelper.extraTimeWidth`
- `ChatHelper.timeAdditionsHash`

Those three already have Java hooks in the cell. Opening `ChatMessageCell.java` for a new icon or text next to the time is automatically wrong unless you first prove those hooks cannot express it.

### Case Study: Forward Count (Do Not Reinvent Origin)
- **What we wanted:** Show how many times a post was forwarded, next to the timestamp.
- **Origin already did this:** `InuConfig.SHOW_FORWARDS_COUNT` + `ChatHelper.timePrefix`.
- **We did it anyway (dropped):** Wrote `patches/entiny/post-forwards-count.patch` — 53 lines in `ChatMessageCell.java`, 4 new fields on the 29k-line cell, custom `ic_repost_mini`, second toggle `SHOW_POST_FORWARDS_COUNT`. It lacked `timeAdditionsHash`, so the cell failed to relayout on appearance.
- **Origin's clean approach (kept):** 0 lines in `ChatMessageCell.java`. Added forwards count into `ChatHelper.timePrefix`, handled `extraTimeWidth` and `timeAdditionsHash`.
- **Side by side:**
  | | Ours (dropped) | Origin (kept) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Where | `ChatMessageCell.java` (4 call sites) | `ChatHelper.kt` |
  | Stock hotspot | Yes (29k lines, #1 rebase casualty) | No |
  | Toggle | `SHOW_POST_FORWARDS_COUNT` (dup) | `SHOW_FORWARDS_COUNT` |
  | Drawable | New `ic_repost_mini` | Stock `mini_forwarded` |
  | Relayout | Missed `timeAdditionsHash` | Hash + extra width |
  | Origin merge | Conflicts + broken braces | Untouched |
  | Java lines | 53 lines in cell | 0 lines in cell |

**Why origin's is better:**
1. One owner: Timestamp extras already live in `ChatHelper`.
2. Layout works: Hash + width invalidate correctly.
3. The cell is poison: Every Telegram update touches `ChatMessageCell`. 53 lines there is endless rebase conflict debt.
4. One toggle: Two settings rows fight in preferences.
5. It already existed.

We deleted `post-forwards-count`. Never bring it back.

### Checklist Before Writing a Patch
- [ ] Origin does **not** already have this (`InuConfig` / helpers / `series`).
- [ ] Existing helper/hook cannot express it (`timePrefix`, `addMenuItems`, etc.).
- [ ] New Java is a guard + helper call, not a rewrite of stock.
- [ ] New resources are in `src/res/`, not in the patch.
- [ ] Default-off is stock-identical.
- [ ] You are **not** editing `ChatMessageCell` for timestamp-adjacent UI.

### Minimal Wiring Pattern
```java
public void doSomething() {
    if (desu.inugram.InuConfig.MY_TOGGLE.getValue()) {
        MyHelper.handle(this);
        return;
    }
    // ...stock code unchanged...
}
```
- Guard goes **before** stock, early-returns when fork takes over.
- For mode-dependent behavior, prefer an `if`/`else` wrapper with **no re-indentation** of the stock branch — keeps rebases trivial.
- When extending behavior rather than replacing it, **run fork logic after** the stock block. Don't rewrite stock.
- When figuring out stock code history/regressions, make sure to run git **inside** the `worktree/` dir. Root dir does NOT track stock history.

### Exposing Stock Internals
- `private` field/method needed from fork? Change to `public`. That is the whole patch.
- Adding a new field/method/overload to a stock class? Prefix `inu_` (e.g. `inu_addTab`, `inu_internalType`).
- Prefer exposing over adding. Adding to a base class is rebase-fragile — look for an existing extension point first.

### Helper Boundary
- <~5–7 lines of logic → inline in the patch.
- Bigger → extract to a Kotlin helper in `src/kotlin/helpers/<area>/`.
- Helper reads `InuConfig` itself; don't pass config values as parameters.
- One helper per feature area (e.g. `FolderHelper` owns icons + DB + layout + drawing).

## 4. Commonly Touched Stock Files

Paths under `worktree/TMessagesProj/src/main/java/`. Files >2k lines: never read top-to-bottom. Use `rg` for the exact symbol, then read with small offsets.

| File | ~Lines | Owns |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `org/telegram/ui/ChatActivity.java` | 46k | Chat screen |
| `org/telegram/ui/Cells/ChatMessageCell.java` | 29k | Message bubble |
| `org/telegram/ui/PhotoViewer.java` | 24k | Photo/video viewer + preview for ChatAttachAlert |
| `org/telegram/messenger/MessagesController.java` | 24k | Messages domain state |
| `org/telegram/ui/ProfileActivity.java` | 17k | Profile screen |
| `org/telegram/ui/Components/ChatActivityEnterView.java` | 15k | Message input — voice, attach, text |
| `org/telegram/ui/DialogsActivity.java` | 14k | Main page / dialogs list |
| `org/telegram/ui/Components/SharedMediaLayout.java` | 13k | Profile shared-media player |
| `org/telegram/messenger/MediaDataController.java` | 10k | Stickers, reactions, recent data |
| `org/telegram/ui/LoginActivity.java` | 10k | Login flow |
| `org/telegram/ui/LaunchActivity.java` | 9k | Root activity |
| `org/telegram/ui/Components/ChatAttachAlert.java` | 7k | Attachments panel |
| `org/telegram/ui/Cells/DialogCell.java` | 6k | Single dialog row |
| `org/telegram/ui/Components/ChatAttachAlertPhotoLayout.java` | 5k | Attach panel photo grid |
| `org/telegram/messenger/LocaleController.java` | 4.5k | i18n |
| `org/telegram/ui/Components/ReactionsContainerLayout.java` | 2.6k | Reactions bar in message menu |
| `org/telegram/ui/Components/FilterTabsView.java` | 2k | Folder tabs strip in DialogsActivity |
| `org/telegram/messenger/SharedConfig.java` | 2k | Stock prefs |
| `org/telegram/ui/Components/Reactions/ReactionsLayoutInBubble.java` | 1.9k | Inline reaction chips on messages |
| `org/telegram/ui/Components/EditTextBoldCursor.java` | 1.3k | Text input base |
| `org/telegram/ui/MainTabsActivity.java` | 1k | Main bottom tabs |
| `org/telegram/ui/Components/glass/GlassTabView.java` | 0.6k | Liquid-glass tab rendering |
| `org/telegram/messenger/LiteMode.java` | 0.4k | Perf flag presets |

---

## 5. Shared Extension Points (`patches/hooks/`)

Standalone hook patches expose surfaces that multiple features consume. Intentionally no user-visible effect on their own.

| Patch | What it Exposes |
| --- | --- |
| `admin-logs.patch` | Hooks inside admin logs activity |
| `app-loader.patch` | Custom `ApplicationLoaderImpl` instead of stock |
| `chat-activity.patch` | ChatActivity hooks — message menu (`ChatHelper.addMenuItems`/`processMenuOption`), `undoView`, etc. |
| `icon-replacement.patch` | Custom resource loader for icon replacement |
| `internal-web-app.patch` | `WebViewRequestProps.inu_internalType` + `WebAppHelper.getInternalBotName` |
| `loginactivity.patch` | Hooks inside LoginActivity |
| `messagescontroller.patch` | Access `MessagesController` instances as created |
| `notifications-controller.patch` | Hooks inside NotificationsController |
| `photo-viewer-menu.patch` | `PhotoViewerHelper.{addMenuItems,updateMenuItems,resetMenuItems,handleMenuClick}` + `inu_getCurrentPhotoFile` |
| `popup-swipeback.patch` | Foreground translation + touch coords on swipeback popup |
| `profile-menu.patch` | `ProfileHelper.addMenuItems` + `ProfileHelper.handleMenuClick` |
| `universal-recycler.patch` | Extra features in `UniversalRecyclerView` used by settings pages |

---

## 6. Central Lifecycle (`InuHooks`)

`src/kotlin/InuHooks.kt` dispatches generic lifecycle events. Feature logic stays in its own helper.

| Method | Called From | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `init(Context)` | `ApplicationLoader.onCreate` | Bootstrap `InuConfig`, fonts, crash reporter, etc. |
| `onResume(LaunchActivity)` | `LaunchActivity.onResume` | Monet refresh, crash sheet |
| `onUpdate(TLObject?, Int)` | update dispatch | Fork `LoginHelper` hook; feeds status to `PresenceHelper` |
| `onDeepLink(LaunchActivity, Intent?)` | deeplink handling | Passcode + settings deeplinks |
| `onAuthSuccess(Int)` | login flow | Clear per-account passcode |
| `onMessagesControllerCreated(MessagesController, Int)` | `MessagesController.<init>` | Per-account setup (maps, pins, presence, recent chats, badge manifest) |
| `onNewMessage(TLRPC.Message, Int)` | `didReceiveNewMessages` observer | Generic message dispatch (fans out to `UpdateHelper` etc.) |
| `syncDoubleTapDelay()` | fork + `init` | Propagate `DOUBLE_TAP_DELAY` into gesture detectors |
| `syncAnimationSpeed()` | fork + `init` | Propagate `ANIMATION_SPEED` into animators |
| `syncChatInputRowHeight()` | fork + `init` | Propagate classic-ui row height/padding into EnterView statics |
| `getCurrentAppIconLicense()` | About page | Current launcher icon's license string |

---

## 7. `InuConfig` Pattern

```kotlin
@JvmField val HIDE_STORIES = BoolItem("hide_stories", false)
```
- Always `@JvmField` so Java sees a field, not `getHIDE_STORIES()`.
- Types: `BoolItem`, `IntItem`, `FloatItem`, `StringItem`, or subclass `Item<T>` for enums.
- From Java: `InuConfig.HIDE_STORIES.getValue()` — **never `.value`**.
- Pref key is snake_case. SharedPreferences name: `inugram`.

---

## 8. Database (`InuDatabaseHelper`)

- Stock schema and `LAST_DB_VERSION` are strictly off-limits.
- Fork versioning lives in `inu_kv`, managed by `InuDatabaseHelper`.
- Fork tables use `inu_*` prefix, created and migrated in `InuDatabaseHelper.migrate()`.
- Populate fork fields by **hooking** stock load/save calls — never edit stock SQL schemas.

---

## 9. Settings UI & Search Registry

- Extend `desu.inugram.ui.settings.SettingsPageActivity`.
- Add toggles to existing categories:
  - `AppearanceSettingsActivity` — general appearance
  - `ChatsSettingsActivity` — chat appearance, headers, menus
  - `MessagesSettingsActivity` — bubbles, reactions, sticker size
  - `DialogsSettingsActivity` — chat list appearance, pills, FAB
  - `AnnoyancesSettingsActivity` — removing stock annoyances
  - `BehaviorSettingsActivity` — general behavior
- **Settings Search (`SearchRegistry`):**
  - Each searchable `*SettingsActivity` declares `@JvmField val PAGE = SearchRegistry.Page(...)` in its companion.
  - Register in `SearchRegistry.pages`. Slugs MUST be globally unique (enforced by `entinychecker.ts`). Renaming a slug is breaking.

---

## 10. Strings & Assets

- Strings: `src/res/values/strings_inu.xml`. Keys prefixed `Inu` (`InuHideStories`). Info/subtitles end in `Info` (`InuHideStoriesInfo`).
- Assets: `src/res/drawable/`, `src/res/drawable-xxhdpi/`, `src/res/assets/`.
- New asset dir → register in `scripts/config.ts` → `forkSyncFiles`.
- **New locale (`values-<iso>/strings_inu.xml`) needs all three, or the app silently shows English:**
  1. `forkSyncFiles` entry in `scripts/config.ts`.
  2. Locale added to `localeFilters` in `TMessagesProj_App/build.gradle` (lives in `entiny__build-configuration`).
  3. Symlink actually created in `worktree/` — run `bun run setup` (or `linkForkSource`) and check `worktree/TMessagesProj/src/main/res/values-<iso>/strings_inu.xml` exists.

---

## 11. Java ↔ Kotlin Gotchas

- **`.value` vs `.getValue()`:** From Java, always call `InuConfig.FOO.getValue()`. `.value` is a Kotlin property wrapper.
- **Kotlin `object`:** Accessed as `MyHelper.INSTANCE.method()` from Java unless annotated with `@JvmStatic`.
- **`LayoutHelper` margins:** `createLinear` / `createFrame` margin parameters take dp. Overloads like the 6-arg `createLinear(w, h, l, t, r, b)` exist **only in the Float variant**. Always write `12f`, not `12`, to avoid Kotlin compile errors.
- **No re-indentation:** Never re-indent stock code to wrap it in an `if`. Use early returns or keep indentation identical to avoid merge conflicts.

---

## 12. Upstream Inugram Sync & Merge Hygiene

Upstream (`teidesu/inugram`) is an external dependency. Merges from upstream frequently overwrite branding or leave silent regressions.

1. **Assume the merge is broken until proven otherwise.**
2. **Never leave conflict markers:** Any `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` is a hard stop.
3. **Restore Branding Immediately:**
   ```bash
   bun run scripts/apply-branding.ts
   ```
   Updates `google-services.json` (`ua.entaytion.entinygram`) and restores `entiny__branding`. Never edit `misc/build-support.patch` for branding.
4. **Post-Merge Checks:**
   - Scan for markers across `.xml`, `.kt`, `.java`, `.gradle`.
   - Check well-formedness of touched `res/values/*.xml`.
   - Verify stock API renames (e.g. `UItem.text2` → `UItem.subtext`).
5. **Known Upstream Bugs to Leave Off:**
   - `NON_ISLAND_SHARED_MEDIA_TABS` (`SharedMediaLayout.inu_dockOffset()` clips profile media tabs). Upstream bug; keep toggle OFF.
